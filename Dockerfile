# fails, so 3.13 breaks the image. Shape inference needs lightrdf, so pin the
# Python rather than drop the dependency. The host venvs run 3.13 with a
# lightrdf built before this became an issue — don't take those as evidence 3.13
# works from a clean install.

# --workers 1 is deliberate, not a placeholder. services/job_runner.py runs a
# per-process daemon thread that polls the jobs table; a second worker would
# start a second runner and the two would race to claim the same upload job.
# Scale with threads instead.
# --timeout covers the slowest single request, which is a large browser upload
# streaming in; loading is asynchronous and does not count against it. Web
# sources bypass this path entirely by downloading inside the job.
