# Koetai — FAIR SPARQL Endpoint Platform

**Koetai** is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for hosting FAIR SPARQL endpoints. Each dataset picks its own triplestore — Fuseki and Oxigraph are the two that ship ready to run (see [Triplestores](#triplestores)). It lets researchers publish RDF datasets as queryable SPARQL endpoints with shapes, examples, REST APIs, and schema visualisations — all under a single hosted service.

Live instance: **https://koetai.semscape.org**

### Repositories

This project is hosted on two forges. **Codeberg is the primary repository** — all issues, feature requests, and pull requests should be filed there. GitHub is a secondary mirror.

## Three modes

The same codebase runs as the public hosted platform, as a self-hosted instance
for a group, or as a single-user install. `KOETAI_MODE` picks which.

| | `community` | `internal` | `local` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Who it's for | the public site at koetai.semscape.org | a group hosting for its members | one person, one machine |
| Sign-in | ORCID OAuth | ORCID OAuth | none — auto-signed-in |
| Who may register | invitation-only | allowlist (ORCID / email domain) | n/a — single user |
| Needs ORCID credentials | yes | yes | no |
| Owner in URLs | the user's ORCID iD | the user's ORCID iD | `local` (override with `LOCAL_ORCID`) |

`community` is the default.

**internal** lets an organisation run its own instance. Members sign in with
ORCID and are admitted automatically if they match the allowlist — no
per-person invites. The host controls membership with three settings:

```bash
KOETAI_MODE=internal
INTERNAL_ADMIN_ORCIDS=0000-0000-0000-0000        # always allowed, and made admin
INTERNAL_ALLOWED_ORCIDS=0000-0001-1111-1111,...  # specific people
INTERNAL_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=your-institute.org      # anyone with a public ORCID email here
```

Put your own ORCID in `INTERNAL_ADMIN_ORCIDS` to bootstrap a fresh instance.
Domain matching is best-effort — it only works when a user has made an email
public on ORCID — so the ORCID allowlist is the reliable path.

**local** needs no ORCID app and no invitation; the ORCID block in `.env` can
stay blank.

```bash
KOETAI_MODE=local BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002 python3 app.py
```

## Triplestores

A dataset's backend is chosen per dataset, in its `platform` column. Every
backend below is implemented in `services/triplestore.py`, but they are not all
equally proven, so this table says plainly where each one stands:

| `platform` | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fuseki` | **Tested, ships by default** | Apache Jena TDB2. Started by `docker compose up`. The safest choice. |
| `oxigraph` | **Tested** | `docker compose --profile oxigraph up -d`. Smaller and lighter than Fuseki; needs 0.5.11 or later (see below). |
| `qlever` | **Queries only, by design** | Point it at an index you built yourself and it answers queries. Uploading through Koetai does not work and is not really fixable — see below. |
| `virtuoso` | *Implemented, untested* | Reached over the same SPARQL 1.1 + Graph Store Protocol client as Fuseki and Oxigraph, and configurable in `.env`, but not exercised. |
| `blazegraph` | *Implemented, untested* | As above. Uses `context-uri` rather than `graph` for the Graph Store parameter. |
| `rdf4j` | *Implemented, untested* | As above. |
| `comunica` | *Implemented, needs Node* | Not a store at all — see [Federation datasets](#federation-datasets-comunica). Needs `@comunica/query-sparql` on `PATH`, which the Docker image does not include. |

"Implemented, untested" means the code path exists and is configured the same way
as the tested ones — they are all instances of one SPARQL 1.1 + Graph Store
Protocol client differing only in URL layout and auth — but nobody has run
Koetai against them. Treat them as a starting point, not a promise. Adding
another compliant store is a few lines in the same registry.

The **New Dataset** form lists every backend above, ordered with the reachable
ones first and one of those preselected. A store that is not running is shown
but cannot be chosen, and the untested ones are labelled as such, so the form
reflects what the install actually has rather than a fixed list.

Configure only the stores you actually run; the rest report as unavailable. See
`.env.example`.

> **QLever and durability**: QLever holds SPARQL UPDATEs in memory unless the
> server is started with `--persist-updates` (Qleverfile: `PERSIST_UPDATES = true`).
> Without it, uploaded data is silently lost when the engine stops.

> **Oxigraph needs 0.5.11 or later**: earlier 0.5.x releases honour only the
> *last* `named-graph-uri` of a SPARQL request and drop the rest, which left a
> dataset's `/examples` and `/shapes` graphs unreachable through `GRAPH` and made
> the query editor's prefilled query return nothing. Fixed in
> [0.5.11](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/releases/tag/v0.5.11)
> ([#1862](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/issues/1862),
> [#1835](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/issues/1835)), which
> `ghcr.io/oxigraph/oxigraph:latest` now resolves to.

### Disk usage

Two things surprise people here, and both bite hardest on the large datasets
these stores exist for.

**An index is several times its source.** A 203 MB N-Triples file (2.4M triples)
became about 1.1 GB of TDB2. That was synthetic data with every subject and
literal distinct, so it is close to a worst case for dictionary compression —
real vocabulary repeats and does better — but budget a multiple of the raw size,
not a margin on it. Uploaded sources are stored too unless
`KEEP_UPLOADED_SOURCES=false` (see `.env.example`).

**Deleting data does not give the space back.** Neither store returns freed
pages to the filesystem; they keep them for reuse. After deleting every dataset,
an instance reporting *zero graphs* still held 6.8 GB of Fuseki and 7.3 GB of
Oxigraph. Nothing is wrong — but "no triples" and "no disk used" are unrelated,
and a workflow that loads and drops big graphs grows the high-water mark, not
the current size. Size a host for the former.

To actually reclaim it:

```bash
# Fuseki — compact, then delete the generation it superseded. Compaction writes
# a new Data-NNNN beside the old one; without the second step the directory
# briefly gets *bigger*.
curl -u admin:PASSWORD -X POST http://localhost:3030/\$/compact/koetai
#   ... wait for the task to finish (GET /$/tasks), then:
rm -rf /fuseki/databases/koetai/Data-0001     # the lower-numbered one

# Oxigraph — needs exclusive access, so stop the server first
oxigraph optimize --location /data
```

Those took a Fuseki volume from 6.8 GB to 201 MB and an Oxigraph one from 7.3 GB
to 83 MB. On a local install `docker compose down -v` is the blunter equivalent,
and destroys the data with it.

### QLever is read-only here, and that is deliberate

QLever runs perfectly well as another container — the image is multi-arch, so it
is as happy on ARM as on x86. What does not work is *uploading* to it, and the
reason is structural rather than a missing afternoon's work.

Oxigraph and Fuseki accept data incrementally: a load adds one dataset's triples
into its own named graph and leaves the rest alone. QLever does not work that
way. It serves an index built offline by `qlever-index`, which takes a set of
input files and produces an index — there is no append, merge or incremental
mode. Per-file graphs are supported, so a multi-tenant layout is expressible,
but only by naming every file in every build.

So adding one dataset means rebuilding all of them. On a platform holding a few
hundred million triples, a 50 MB upload would re-index the lot, take every
dataset offline while it ran, and require that every source file ever uploaded
be kept for ever — since the sources are the only thing the index can be rebuilt
from. That is the opposite of what this platform does with uploads everywhere
else.

Two smaller things are also unfixed, and would need doing first even for the
rebuild path: the app sends no access token, which QLever requires for every
update, and the >50 MB path in `services/qlever.py` shells out to the `qlever`
CLI assuming the app and the store share a filesystem, which is not true in a
container split.

The sensible use of QLever here is a **published** dataset rather than an
editable one: build the index yourself, point `QLEVER_PLATFORM_URL` at the
server, and query it. Uploads belong on Oxigraph or Fuseki.

### Loading a large file faster

Uploads go into the store over the SPARQL Graph Store Protocol, which is the
store's transactional path. Oxigraph's own loader is not, and the gap is wide:
2.4M triples measured at **67 s over HTTP against 4 s with the loader**, about
17x. On a multi-gigabyte dump that is the difference between an afternoon and a
coffee.

`scripts/bulk_load.sh` uses it:

```bash
scripts/bulk_load.sh --slug col --file ~/taxa.nt.gz
```

Create the dataset in the UI first — the script reads its graph URI and backend
from the app, rather than inventing a graph nothing would query. A gzip is
streamed into the loader rather than unpacked to disk.

It is a script and not a button because the loader needs exclusive access to the
database directory, so **Oxigraph stops while it runs** and the endpoint is
unavailable until it finishes. The app cannot arrange that: they are separate
containers, and giving the app control of the Docker socket in exchange for a
faster import would hand it root on the host. Fuseki has its own equivalent
(`tdb2.tdbloader`) and QLever builds its index offline; neither is wired up here.

### Federation datasets (Comunica)

A dataset with `platform='comunica'` is **virtual**: it stores no data of its own
and instead federates every query, at request time, across a list of external
sources (SPARQL endpoints, RDF files, TPF) held in its `sources` column. Uploads
don't apply — the dataset *is* its source list. Powered by
[Comunica](https://comunica.dev) (`npm install -g @comunica/query-sparql@^3`).

Reliability follows the sources: if a remote endpoint is down or rate-limits, the
query surfaces that error rather than partial data. Use it to join your own data
against public knowledge graphs without copying them in.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A triplestore — [Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) or
  [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) are the tested pair and both
  ship in `docker-compose.yml`; see [Triplestores](#triplestores) for the rest
- Caddy (for HTTPS / reverse proxy) — not needed for a local install

Optional — only for the shapes, reasoning and diagram features:

- [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) binaries (`riot`, `infer`)
- [RUDOF](https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof) installed as `/usr/bin/rudof`
- Docker (for rdf-config)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Koetai/koetai-platform.git
cd koetai-platform
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# community: set SECRET_KEY, ORCID credentials, BASE_URL, paths
# local:     set KOETAI_MODE=local — the ORCID settings can stay blank
```

Key `.env` variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `KOETAI_MODE` | `community` (default), `internal`, or `local` — see [Three modes](#three-modes) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask session secret. Auto-generated per boot in `local` |
| `ORCID_CLIENT_ID` | ORCID developer app client ID — *community + internal* |
| `ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET` | ORCID developer app client secret — *community + internal* |
| `ORCID_REDIRECT_URI` | e.g. `https://yourdomain.org/auth/callback` — *community + internal* |
| `BASE_URL` | Public base URL |
| `QLEVER_PLATFORM_URL` | QLever instance URL (default `http://localhost:7030`) |
| `DEPLOY_DIR` | Path to qlever-sparql-deployment directory |
| `JENA_BIN` | Path to Jena `bin/` directory |
| `RUDOF_BIN` | Path to rudof binary |
| `SHEXER_VENV` | Path to Python interpreter with shexer installed |

### Running it in the cloud

`deploy/CLOUD-INSTALL.md` is a start-to-finish install on a fresh Linux host,
ending with an HTTPS site you sign into with ORCID. It uses
`docker-compose.prod.yml`, an overlay on the base file that takes the app off the
public interface, puts Caddy in front for certificates, pins the store's image
and caps memory — the base file is a single-user laptop install and should not
face the internet as it stands.

Two things it insists on that are easy to miss: decide `BASE_URL` before loading
anything, because it is written into every dataset's graph URIs, and set
`KOETAI_ADMIN_ORCIDS` to your own ORCID, because registration is invitation-only
and nothing else creates the first administrator.

### Run

```bash
flask --app app run
# or with gunicorn — one worker, many threads (see below):
gunicorn --workers 1 --threads 8 -b 127.0.0.1:3002 app:app
```

Use a **single** gunicorn worker. `services/job_runner.py` runs a per-process
background thread that polls the upload-jobs table; a second worker would start a
second runner and the two would race to claim the same job. Scale with `--threads`,
not `--workers`. The included `koetai-platform.service` systemd unit and the
`Dockerfile` both run one worker.

### Database

```bash
flask --app app shell
>>> from services.db import init_db; init_db()
```

## SPARQL Auto-complete

The built-in SPARQL editor provides auto-complete for:

- **SPARQL keywords** — `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `FILTER`, `OPTIONAL`, `BIND`, etc.
- **Prefix declarations** — typing `PREFIX ` suggests `prefix: <URI>` for 25+ well-known namespaces
- **Local names** — typing `rdfs:` suggests `label`, `subClassOf`, `Class`, etc. for all common vocabularies
- **Declared prefixes** — any `PREFIX` declared in the current query is immediately available

Trigger with **Ctrl+Space** or by typing.
